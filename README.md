# Mallow
My fork of the Pico-8 game "Mellow" by lucatron: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=36520

Changes: 
More land in early stages, less land in later stages.
Lower base speed, slightly higher spin speed, slightly higher jump.
Added a Timer that ends the game at 0. Picking up a flower adds 1 second, beating a stage adds 15.
Added a score system that counts flowers collected and has a bonus 10 per level completed.
Added a gameover state when timer reaches 0 which displays the final score and lets the player restart.
